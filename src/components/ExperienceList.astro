      "Hired upon bootcamp completion as one of the top three performing graduates. <br/> Contributed to and maintained their core CRM product as the sole developer on the project - by far the company's largest codebase, working closely with a manager overseeing multiple concurrent projects. This product was built mainly in Ruby on Rails, with some JavaScript components and a PostgreSQL database. My work consisted of building out various features using API & webhook integrations, implementing event-driven architecture in our CRM to efficiently handle and process incoming data from services like Zoom, Mailchimp, and Typeform. <br>Handled all QA and functional testing, notably for the upgrade from Rails 4 to Rails 7, leading to zero outages post-deployment. <br />Co-maintained the frontend/website with a website manager, where I provided code-related guidance in their transition to RoR, as well as routine UI updates. <br />Redesigned and redeveloped several key components on the company's proprietary learning platform (Compass), from low-fidelity Figma sketches to completed UI, and received recognition for implementing a more pleasant and intuitive User Experience. <br>Mentored a junior developer, getting them accustomed to regular code reviews and issue handling through GitHub.",
